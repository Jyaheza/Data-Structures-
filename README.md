# Data-Structures-
This rep contains a number of Data structures and algorithms programs
These include:
    1. A PostFix algorithm operation emplemantation using a Stack emplemantation of a Linked List 
    2. An AVLTree datastructure 
    3. A BinarySearchTree data structure
    4. A HashTable datastructure that emplements both Linear Probing and Double Hashing
    5. A Singlylinked List and a Doubly LInked list datastructure(Both in the LinkedList Folder)
    6. A Maze project 
    7. A Sorting algorithm 
    8. Recursion algrithm like : The Tower of Hanoi, Recursive Vowel Search, Palidrome, Recusrsive Multiplication.
    9. And a Complexity analysing algorithm
